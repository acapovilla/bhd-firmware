 * @brief Enumeration of command types for the command interpreter.

 * @details List of supported serial commands:
 *
 * Supported commands:
 *
 * - `SETSN XXX`
 *   Sets the device serial number <XXX> (a number between 1 and 999)
 *   Example: `SETSN 123`
 *
 * - `SETDT YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
 *   Sets the current date and time
 *   Example: `SETDT 2024-01-31 01:23:45`
 *
 * Notes:
 * - All commands must be sent in plain ASCII via the serial interface.
 * - Responses or acknowledgments may be printed back over serial.

 * @brief Reads data from the serial port until a newline character is
 * encountered, processes the input by converting it to uppercase, and parses
 * the first word to identify and execute specific commands such as setting the
 * serial number or date and time. It handles unknown commands gracefully and
 * resets the buffer position after processing.
 *
 * @note This function is designed to be called repeatedly in the main loop to
 * continuously check for new commands from the serial port.
 *
 * @note Based on similar function from https://github.com/millerlp/BivalveBit/
 *
 * @todo Implement the GetSerialNumber and GetDateAndTime commands.
 * @todo Add error handling for invalid commands.
